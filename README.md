# ADLB - Asynchronous, Dynamic Load-Balancing for MPI applications

ADLB provides a parallel, distributed (via MPI) task queue to let
applications overcome unbalance and scalability issues via asynchronous,
dynamic load balancing and work stealing.

ADLB provides both `C` and `Fortran` APIs.

**This is a fork of the [original ADLB project](https://www.cs.mtsu.edu/~rbutler/adlb/)
by [Prof. Ralph Butler](https://www.cs.mtsu.edu/~rbutler).
Please find upstream repo [here](http://svn.cs.mtsu.edu/svn/adlbm/trunk).**

## Improvements over upstream

This fork has been created to make easier for users integrating ADLB in modern
code bases, specifically the following improvements have been made:

* portable build system generated by `CMake`;
* code clean up, removed unused and outdated sources;
* code clean up, reduced public interface and header inclusions flowing
  downstream to users;
* auto-generated `Fortran` linkage mangling;
* additional benchmarks;
* bug fixes.

# License

The code in this repo tries really hard to abide by the original license
from upstream. While no proper licensing information is shipped with the original
code, a reference to [MPICH licesing model](http://git.mpich.org/mpich.git/blob/HEAD:/COPYRIGHT)
is reported on the [project's home page](https://www.cs.mtsu.edu/~rbutler/adlb/):
library authors have been contacted to find a proper license for this repo while 
in the meantime a restrictive license has been tentatively adopted
([GPL-3.0](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/gpl-3.0/)) in order to leave
room to relax some terms and switch to a more permissive one (e.g.: a BSD-like).
Please note that a relicense could be necessary in the near future.
