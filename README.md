# ADLB - Asynchronous, Dynamic Load-Balancing for MPI applications

ADLB is a library designed to help rapidly build scalable parallel programs.
ADLB does not achieve scalability solely by load balancing. It also includes some
features that exploit work-stealing as well. Indeed, we sometimes use the phrase instantaneous load balancing via work-stealing to describe ADLB.
