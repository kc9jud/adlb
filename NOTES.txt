    463: add Makefile-crayos_intel for use on Theta and new ANL machine

31 Oct 2015:
    462: rename grid* files and fix grid_uni and grid_daf to work correctly
         correct README.txt about how target/reserve_rank is used for Put

22 Nov 2014:
    461: avoid copy of packet when pushing to new server; better messages about rejected puts

05 Nov 2014:
    460:  more work on PUT_REJECTED including adding pmalloc which is basically a dmalloc just
          for puts on server side; also added c4 to Makefile.in

14 Nov 2014:
    459:  changed adlb.c to deliver more PUT_REJECTED messages to client rather than failing in dmalloc

27 Dec 2013:
    451:  add adlb_with_iallgather.c

15 Dec 2013:
    447:  fix version numbers
    445:  c4 is looking much better, so we are making a pretty significant
          change to adlb.c in which we send status vector messages via a 
          different communicator (adlb_server_comm); also, xq.c is now
          changed to print wq_entry msgs regarding work left in the wq

21 Nov 2013:
    432:  Better version of c4.c after chatting with Steve.  More to come shortly.

20 Nov 2013:
    431:  Initial commit of gfmcAlgorithm.txt (Steve's gfmc pseudocode), and c4.c
          c4.c is intended to be an implementation of of the gfmc pseudocode, but
          it does not yet compile clean.

07 Sept 2013:
    430:  Added some comments at the top of adlb_with_irecvs.c

07 Sept 2013:
    429:  Adding adlb_with_irecvs.c in case I ever want to explore it further.
          It replaces much of the handling of msgs done via Iprobe with a set
          of Irecvs that are left outstanding.  It is a copy of version 428 with
          those changes applied.  Note that there is a large comment at the top
          explaining that it contains bugs until the work is completed.

02 Sept 2013:
    428:  I accidentally left in a re-numbering of message tags when I did version 427,
          so am fixing that here in 428, leaving in the new iq_appends.

02 Sept 2013:
    427:  added five calls to iq_append which were not being called for some iq_create_node's

21 May 2013:
    426:  added jeffhack_21may2013_adlb.c -- comments about it are at the top of the file

14 Feb 2013:
    425:  fix README comments about batch operations

28 Jan 2013:
    424:  add c3

28 Jan 2013:
    423:  have nqueens make sure it receives enough ranks to run

14 Mar 2012:
    421:  fix genfh.py for len of a char string, and to handle continuations correctly

05 Jan 2012:
    420:  add prep_for_commit  to Makefile.in, and supporting python programs

09 May 2011:
    418:  a few prototypes added a suggested by Bob Walkup

07 Feb 2011:
    417:  LDFLAGS in Makefile.in and chgd dprintf to adlbp_dbgprintf to avoid 
          conflict with dprintf in stdio

31 Jan 2011:
    416:  added output to sudoku (by Rusty)

18 Nov 2010:
    415:  added *fake* batch2 stuff to adlbm so Steve's pgms will also compile with adlbr

12 Dec 2009:
    414:  by anthony: updated GetUnexpectedQueue() and friends for V1R4M0 and added
          MPICH2_NUMVERSION so the code works with V1R2, V1R3 and V1R4.

02 Dec 2009:
    413:  eliminate compile warnings when using -Wall

27 Sep 2009:
    412:  change so that there is no more than 1 RFR from one server to another

    407:  have DBG7 print unexpected queue vals all the time
    406:  combine DBG7 and DBG7u fixing DBG7u

03 Sep 2009:
    405:  added some new stats that Steve wants to collect

          2.  turn on DEBUGGING_BGP flag via ifdef for __bg__ || __bgp__

13 Aug 2009:
    **** Steve is getting successful runs using 401 corrected with the 402 fix.
    **** He gets good efficiency (89%) up thru 8 racks (32,000 procs),
    **** but only about 67% with 16 racks (64,000).

          have a common_server_rank >= 0
    393:  fixed bug in handling common_refcnt for batch puts (reset to 0)
          also added a cq_print routine which gets called with other q prints

07 Aug 2009:
    392:  changed Put to never give up trying; print instead of return REJECTED

04 Aug 2009:
    391:  added and committing batcher.c

04 Aug 2009:
    390:  add aprintf_flag to ADLB_Init in the interface

06 Jul 2009:
    389:  turn on use_dbg_prints and DBG4 and DBG7

          Better handling of update tq and statvec in bad rc RFR_RESP.
          Comment out debug print in nq.

29 Jun 2009:
    386:  Turn off out-of-order handling msgs via Iprobe

29 Jun 2009:
    385:  This is a HEAVILY debug version of adlb.c;
          it has lots of DBG prints in it and even special code for 
          looking at the MPI unexpected message queue on the IBM/BGP;
          when we get to a stable point with Steve's code, I will 
          delete and clean up a lot of the stuff

04 Jun 2009:
    384:  Switch to a mode for Put where we try a Put to all
          servers until one will take it, or we reach a point
          where all servers can not take it and believe all 
          other servers to be out of space

01 Jun 2009:
    383:  Fixed bug causing empty Common (zero len) for batches with no common

27 May 2009:
    382:  Fixed bug in TA_RESERVE_RESP inside handling PUT_HDR

24 May 2009:
    381:  Fixed bug created in fix for version 380

24 May 2009:
    380:  Fixed bug in ss_push_query_resp; can not push an item that has
          been Reserved since I requested the Push

23 May 2009:
    379:  Fixed bug in handling ss_push_hdr;
          could possibly hand the new, pushed data to wrong rank on rq

23 May 2009:
    378:  Fixed bug in handling ss_push_query_resp (was not setting ws before usage)

21 May 2009:
    377:  Lots of code chgs; switching to a model in which only one
          copy of common pieces are kept; commons are not pushed but
          those unique pieces with a common can be pushed;  increased
          size of ADLB_HANDLE_SIZE to 5 for the other chgs.
          Also, lots of new code for new version of push.  In particular,
          now push allocates the space on the query and has it available
          when the actual push occurs.  It reclaims the space if data 
          has already disappeared from the pushing server due to a get.

17 May 2009:
    376:  refuse PUT_COMMON if not enough space

08 May 2009:
    375:  cause version updates to adlbf.h and adlb.c

14 Apr 2009:
    374:  added configargs/rmbmac.cfg

14 Mar 2009:
    367:  Add pmcmc.c demo program (Markov Chain Monte Carlo)

12 Mar 2009:
    366:  Put a couple of stats gathering lines inside "if (using_debug_server)"

09 Mar 2009:
    365:  Fix meaning of one of the stats
    364:  Fix bugs in collecting new stats

          deleted some duplicate comments from README.txt

04 Feb 2009:
    354:  add entry for steve in Makefile.in

08 Jan 2009:
    353:  add stdio.h to xq.h

04 Jan 2009:
    352:  cause QMSTAT msgs to be favored by new mainloop Iprobe

02 Jan 2009:
    351:  turn off a debug print
    350:  move malloc of bufidx inside if-stmt

01 Jan 2009:
    349:  Change PUSH_QUERY_RESP so that we no longer send MOVING msg to home_server;
          instead, send MOVING from the server we push the data to (PUSH_HDR); note
          that if the data gets pushed to the home_server, the home_server should
          continue to NOT create a new tq element for it. 
    348:  reverse TEMP chg in 347

31 Dec 2008:
    347:  two changes: 
            1. don't create a tq entry pointing to myself
            2. TEMP: chg PUSH_WORK to Ssend temporarily (fix later)

30 Dec 2008:

    340:  update adlbf.h
    339:  Print prev values in debug_server, even on abort by debug server itself

19 Dec 2008:
    338:  Update adlbf.h
    337:  Fix bug in passing values to debug_server
    336:  Fix bug in debug_server interface

    334:  enhance debug_server (keep msg type that caused DB_PING)
    333:  add nq.c

15 Dec 2008:
    332:  Fix 2 bugs in handling of pushed-targeted work

          Fix bug in which Put which fails over to anotehr server 
          may have to push the common part first if it is part of
          a batch put with common data.

06 Dec 2008:
    328:  Chg max_wq_count to be a value obtained via Info.
          Fix bug with ifdef around Info inside adlb_prof.c

04 Dec 2008:
    327:  Print max size of wq in final stats.
          Added max_count to xq structs and kept track of largest size
          (in xq.h and xq.c).
    326:  New comments in README.txt about Anthony's new configure setup.
    325:  Replace adlb.c which Anthony had committed with CR/LF problems,
          i.e. looked like a dos file.  Note that this version includes 
          updates for the new code using Send (vs Ssend) and Rsends.

01 Dec 2008:
    321 etc:  Anthony updates for new config.

15 Oct 2008:
    320:  Fix issues in config.py in and adlb_conf.h handling fortran interface
          Also new rev number in adlbf.h

15 Oct 2008:
    318-319:  Chgs by Anthony

14 Oct 2008:
    317:  Fix bug in adlbf.c: need to use MPI_Fint for MPI_Comm in Fortran

10 Oct 2008:
    316:  Fix bug in adlbf.c: need to use MPI_Comm_c2f

01 Oct 2008:
    315:  Fix bug in Makefile and Makefile.cluster for building c1mpilog

23 Sep 2008:
    314:  Fix bug in Makefile.sicortex for building c1mpilog

23 Sep 2008:
    313:  Remove adlb_log.c and put ifdef's for logging into adlb_prof.c
          Update Makefile's accordingly

11 Sep 2008:
    312:  Add ADLB_Abort wrapper to adlb_log.c
          Fix bug in building log pgms for sicortex.

10 Sep 2008:
    311:  Change adlb_log.c so that by default we log a guess as to when the 
          user app is working and what type it is working on.  Guess by logging
          the type user retrieves via Get_reserved.
    310:  Alter adlb.c to only time waits on the rq which are not either first
          or last.  The first may be long during init and the last may be long
          during wait for wind-down.

6 Sep 2008:
    309:  Fix value of ADLB_NO_CURRENT_WORK in adlbf.h

5 Sep 2008:
    308:  Add support for some new stats-gathering code for Steve.

    306:  Fix bug in periodic logging specific to the new updates
29 Aug 2008:
    305:  Restore a debug print that Steve likes and update adlbf.h
29 Aug 2008:
    304:  New code to have an app rank try an alternative server if the default
          one cannot accept a Put.  This requires the default server to create
          a tq entry if the work has a target rank.

26 Aug 2008:
    303:  Remove extra setting of prev_qmstat_msg_time while handling Batch

25 Aug 2008:
    302:  Move some stuff around in Makefile.sicortex
25 Aug 2008:
    301:  Update adlbf.h to give a new release to Steve.
25 Aug 2008:
    298:  Add Makefile.debug_sicortex that shows how to build c1, etc.
          using the tools to examine early queue, from Gingold.

20 Aug 2008:
    297:  Further separate pinned and targeted work.  In particular,
          make sure the qlen in qmstat_tbl does not include either
          pinned or targeted work.  Also make sure type_hi_prio counts
          do not include them.

19 Aug 2008:
    296:  New versions of Makefile.sicortex and Makefile.bgp with
          enhancements preferred by Steve.

    295:  Changed adlb.c and xq.[hc] removing rfr_rank field from rq
          entries.  Instead keep a vector rfr_to_rank for each rank in
          the run which tells if it has an outstanding RFR.  Don't have
          2 or more RFRs out at once for a single rank.  Also altered
          occurrences of qm_stat to be qmstat.

15 Aug 2008:
    294:  This is a significant new version where we have switched to
          a new model for the QMSTAT msgs, i.e. there is just one 
          QMSTAT msg generated at regular intervals by the master
          server.  I have removed an extra Iprobe that specifically
          checks for this msg and may speed up the time around the
          loop somewhat in some cases.  Also, I have commented out a
          special call to MPI_Test just for that type which was also
          intended to speed up the send of it a little bit.
          If we want to restore from this version to the last good one
          that used many small QMSTAT msgs, then I should restore to 
          rev 293.

08 Aug 2008:
    285:  I am not giving this one to Steve.  But it is a change 
          that affects a lot of files:
                skel.c adlb.c c1.c tsp.c adlb.h adlbf.c adlbf.h
                NOTES.txt adlb_prof.c adlb_log.c f1.f README.txt
          I left Set_no_more_work there for the short term but
          added Set_problem_done.
          I added return code #define's to the .h files and used
          them in the .c and .f files.  These are described in the
          READMEt.txt.

05 Aug 2008:
    281:  altered adlb.c to send_qm_stat msgs only at particular
          intervals (1 second right now), and at BATCH_DONE;
          also altered its operation on RFR_RESP for the situation
          in which there was no work to reserve; put the set of
          types that could not be found in the message and use them
          to alter the qmstat tbl; note we continue to alter the 
          tbl based on the local rq entry if it is still there, but
          sometimes that entry has been removed due to a Put


01 Aug 2008:
    I am going to start using this file to keep some notes about the
    state of the adlbm project.  In particular, my present plans are
    to keep additional notes about some of the bigger revisions beyond
    what you might get out of 'svn log'.

01 Aug 2008:
    274:  we are currently at this revision, but I hope to shortly do
          one or more commits that will be rather significant, esp some
          changes to adlb.c that move us from Probe to Iprobe in the
          main loop.
    278:  I am now committing adlb.c, adlb.h, and tsp.c which implement
          and use Iprobe, and support detection of exhaustion by looking
          to see if all app ranks are on the rq.  This file will be part
          of the commit.
